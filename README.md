## About The Project

The goal of **tolist** is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for tracking daily tasks. It was developed with a focus on clean code, a reactive UI, and a decoupled architecture, making it both scalable and easy to maintain. This project emphasizes leveraging the latest technologies from Google, including Jetpack Compose for the UI and other Jetpack libraries for architecture and data handling.

* **IDE:** Android Studio
* **Language:** Kotlin
* **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose
* **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

### **Backend (Fullstack Component)**

**Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Firebase

## Features

* **Create, Read, Update & Delete (CRUD)** tasks seamlessly.
* **Mark Tasks Complete:** Easily toggle the completion status of any task.
* **Modern UI:** A beautiful and intuitive interface built entirely with Jetpack Compose.
* **State-driven UI:** The UI reacts to state changes, ensuring consistency and reliability.
* **Synchronization:** Syncs with a backend service to keep your to-do list updated across sessions (if a backend is configured).

---

## Architecture

This app is built using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture pattern, which is highly recommended for modern Android development.

* **Model:** Represents the data layer, handling data from both the local database (Room) and the remote API.
* **View:** The UI layer, built with Jetpack Compose. It observes the ViewModel for state changes and is responsible for displaying data to the user.
* **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds and processes all the data required by the UI and exposes it as observable state, surviving configuration changes.
